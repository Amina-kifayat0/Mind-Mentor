Project Introduction: Mental Health is an integral part of a person’s overall well-being and is vital for living a balanced and fulfilling life. Unfortunately, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression are becoming increasingly common worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO), more than 264 million people suffer from depression, while anxiety disorders affect approximately 284 million people. Mental Health problems can impact a person’s emotional, psychological, and social functioning and untreated conditions can lead to serious consequences, including chronic stress, inability to perform daily tasks and in severe cases, self-harm. Despite the prevalence and gravity of these issues, many individuals do not receive the support they need, either due to stigma, lack of awareness, or difficulty accessing mental health services. 
In response to this growing need for mental health support, the AI-Powered Mental Health Monitoring System provides a digital solution to help individuals detect potential mental health concerns early on. The system offers a comprehensive yet accessible approach for users to access their mental health, particularly focusing on anxiety and depression, two of the most common mental health disorders. Upon signing up, users will be required to provide some basic information and grant permissions to access their social media accounts for sentiment analysis. They will then take two clinically-proven assessments: PHQ-9(Patient Health Questionnaire) for detecting depression and GAD-7(Generalized Anxiety Disorder) for identifying anxiety levels.  By combining the results of these assessments with sentiment analysis from the user’s social media activity, the system generate insights into their mental health status. Based on the findings, it can detect symptoms of anxiety or depression and provide generalized recommendations. For individuals who may need further assistance, the system suggests licensed therapists and facilitates appointment booking, streamlining the process of accessing professional care. The ultimate goal is to create an intuitive, non-intrusive platform that helps people take charge of their mental health and seek timely intervention when necessary, offering both self-assessment and guided professional support.
